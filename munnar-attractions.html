            <h3>Echo Point</h3>
            <p>An "Echo Point" is a location, often a hill or valley, where shouting or making a loud sound creates a noticeable echo or repetition of the sound. This phenomenon occurs due to sound waves bouncing off surrounding surfaces (like hills or cliffs) and returning to the listener, creating a delayed version of the original sound. </p>
